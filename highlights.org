* Cu core level shifts were measured on a composition spread alloy film as a function of bulk composition

* An anomalous core level shift was observed in the region where the B2 structured alloy forms

* Density functional theory calculations showed the anomalous core level shift was due to the formation of the ordered B2 phase
